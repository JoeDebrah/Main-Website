### Description

🛠️ This is an interesting project i built with the help of the resources available of the react-bootstrap & react-hook-form website. It is a simple website about myself that links other projects i've worked on and a contact form built with react-bootstrap react-hook-form and validated with zod. This was largely built with react-bootstrap & react-hook-form.
